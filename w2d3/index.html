<!-- Dear professor,
   I have have spent the better part of Saturday evening completing past assignments
   and reading about inheritance while attempting the exercises. I found reading
   and understanding the notes first more helpful. 

   I have done the first part of part one of the assignment which has helped me 
   to appreciate constructors versus object literals, the value of "this", 
   the use of the property [[Prototype]], how to set a correct inheritance
   hieracy and how properties and methods are accessed in the hierachy.

   I will continue with the rest of the assignment and my complete assignment
   will be available at the link below by end of Sunday.

   Thank you!
