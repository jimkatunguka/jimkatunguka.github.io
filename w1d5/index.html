<h2>My Javascript Solution</h2> 
<h4>
<p>
 Dear Professor,
</p>

 In the link below are my javascript solutions for 
 the exercise I used the rest of the evening to do
 the homework and I finished it by dinner time. 
 It was mostly easier for me save for the second
 last problem whose test I could not figure out 
 because the expected and actual outputs show 
 different types and hence the test fails
 even when a console log shows otherwise.
